    <h1 align centre>iQoo Z9 Review</h1>
    <p><strong>TLDR; Hardware is as good as horrible is the software.</strong></p>

    <p>I bought an iQoo Z9 (8GB variant), and I am really dissatisfied with the phone.</p>

    <h1>Yes, I did my research before buying!</h1>

    <p>I knew iQoo doesn't provide custom ROM support so was skeptical about it. I did my research over the internet but couldn't find any good, detailed reviews other than those cringe Youtubers who never do proper analysis of phones. I was convinced with hardware specs but I was highly doubtful over the software experience as I was supposed to be the first iQoo buyer in my circle. Did my search queries on Reddit as well. Later discovered this sub and from the posts and comments I learned everything is fine with this phone along with the software experience other than some bloatware. Trust me I searched over Youtube, scrolled multiple pages on Google and other forums like XDA and no one mentioned problems in any proper review post.</p>

    <p>After 3 months of usage, I can definitely tell that the FuntouchOS has lots of bugs and iQoo's optimizations are horrible that it really frustrates you. I am so disappointed that the majority of the community praises this brand but have never pointed out these small problems over their usage.</p>

    <h1>Image Color issues:</h1>

    <p>The most annoying one! The HDR and color issues are so bad.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>If I open any picture on my stock gallery app or apply wallpaper, all the colors would wash away. When I try to open in any other photos app (Google Photos or FOSS) - the colors were retained. I have tried to record it, but the video was not able to show the obvious visible cues. You can replicate it.</li>
        <li>For .heic format (images taken from iPhone) photos they will wash out in other apps too when <em>expand them to full screen view.</em> In grid mode it is fine. This is such a weird issue specific to my phone.</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>
        <p>(Do note I have also tried to use HEIC to jpg convertors during the test, I had night mode turned off, Display color on Standard. No battery saver. The issue still exists on other modes. I have also tested this in all brightness ranges since its a HDR display.)</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><em>Before the June patch, the colors were washed even in other apps when expanded to full view.</em></p>

    <h1>Performance issues:</h1>

    <p>iQoo has specifically tweaked its performance for BGMI, Free Fire, CoDM and then people form a generalized opinion of the phone's performance over it. Well played iQoo.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Now when you will try any other demanding games (still lighter than pubg and codm) like low demanding <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.hexage.flt">Flying Tank</a>, the frame rate was good as expected but it'll stutter and crackle the audio so much, it's unplayable. Play with a headset and it'll be fine again. I have no idea if all the iQoo mobiles are this badly capable. There's surely very trash optimisation and biased tweaks towards those battleground games.</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>
        <p>(Do note that I have more than 30GB free space, used Monster Gaming Mode, and battery at full charge with no saving setting.)</p>
    </blockquote>

    <ul>
        <li>When I tried <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wb.goog.lbbg">Lego Batman</a> the frame rate lagged so much along with audio! It was so disappointing to see the device giving up on medium demanding games like these. I remember I had a smooth experience with my snap625 phone while playing <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wb.goog.legoswtfa&hl=en">Lego Star Wars TFA</a>. How is my Dimensity 7200 usable if I can't even utilize it properly?</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Media upload on Instagram</h1>

    <p>When you upload stories or videos on Instagram the video quality is worse than I saw on Samsung devices. I am aware that there has to be a license acquired by companies for full upload, no one mentioned iQoo doesn't have it. This was a small issue to me compared to other ones so I am fine with this.</p>

    <h1>UI UX and other issues:</h1>

    <p>Things I was fine with because (you're getting good specs in less money!)</p>

    <ul>
        <li>bloatware</li>
        <li>Jovi home integration</li>
        <li>global search and its embedded ads.</li>
        <li>theme/app store notifs</li>
        <li>low speaker volumes (they gave a volume booster mode)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>What I hated and was bothered:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Bad UX, you CANNOT swipe navigate to tabs in Phone and Gallery app. You have to also tap and make the call logs field active before it displays the top header tabs of "All" and "Missed Calls".</li>
        <li>No action buttons (End, Speaker) in notification while on call. The notification isn't even prioritized and gets stuffed between other notifs!</li>
        <li>Cannot force 60Hz, it'll randomly switch to Auto mode.</li>
        <li>Forced blue color background on call screen. Weird way of using contact profile photos too.</li>
        <li>Blocky design elements rather than round ones. Come on man every other brand has adapted them but this one.</li>
        <li>My phone randomly creates a clone app in my app drawer of any app and is only get rid of by restarting</li>
        <li>Heating problem (although i can say I'm fine with it)</li>
        <li>Lots and LOTS of telemetry and tracking calls. I have attached my NextDNS logs of around 20 days (custom denylist of vivoglobal.com). I am aware some might be necessary like checking software updates; though i have disabled auto-check. Still, its a lot. Xiaomi mobiles have similar issue.</li>

    </ul>

    <h1>What I liked:</h1>

    <p>The hardware is nice, if only it had good software to fully make the mobile enjoyable.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Good battery, great charging speed</li>
        <li>Great 5G signals where other phones lack</li>
        <li>Great camera. The beauty filters are obnoxious but can be turned off completely.</li>
        <li>Splash resistant (not daring enough to test it though)</li>
        <li>In built call recording with no announcement.</li>
        <li>Some features inside Game mode which I wished existed as standalone.</li>
        <li>Floating widget.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Some issues might not be bothersome for others, but while vouching for its software experience I saw no one clearly mentioning about these attention worthy issues. Everyone just read out the specs and anututu scores and judge from that. These things did make my experience worse. I believe other iQoo mobiles must have the same problems. They cannot be recommended as a "Go for it" mobile but more a "Be warned" one!</p>

    <p>I cannot resell the phone and buy another due to personal reasons. Right now I'm waiting for FuntouchOS 15 to fix these things.</p>

    <p>I have no intentions to target anyone. Just that I am utterly disappointed that everyone ignored these bugs and bad implementation while discussing and recommending the iqoo brand which influenced many people like me. Hence I gave my opinions.</p>
